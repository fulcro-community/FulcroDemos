Small demos of how to do various things in Fulcro, leveraging https://github.com/awkay/workspaces[Workspaces] for running all the demo applications.

Demos that need a backend use in-browser Pathom (similarly to https://github.com/holyjak/minimalist-fulcro-template-backendless[minimalist-fulcro-template-backendless]).

=== Usage

Run `yarn install` and then either `yarn run it` or directly `npx shadow-cljs watch :workspaces`.

Then navigate to http://localhost:9001 and enjoy. This opens the Workspaces UI, which displays all the available "cards" (i.e. demo applications). Just click on one to display it. You can also maximize it via its â ‡ menu -> _Solo_, see its source from there etc. Use the _[Inspector]_ button to open Fulcro Inspect focused on that app.

=== Contributing

Simply add a new `src/examples/<whatever>_cards.cljs` with your content.
